## Project Summary

The purpose of this project was to consolidate my understanding of making a C.R.U.D application from a front end perspective.

Neat Tabletop Reviews is a board game review and and discussion website.
Users can:
- Select their user
- View and vote on reviews as well as adding new reviews. 
- Refine reviews by category, sort by a desired key, order by ascending/descending, access different pages and limit results shown per page.
- Add comments to existing reviews which also has a vote option.
- Delete their own comments or reviews.

This front-end project connects to a back-end api which I also created, the link to that repo is here:
