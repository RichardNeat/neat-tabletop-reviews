## Project Summary

The purpose of this project was to consolidate my understanding of making a C.R.U.D application from a front end perspective.

Neat Tabletop Reviews is a board game review and and discussion website, users can view and vote on reviews as well as adding new reviews. Comments can be added to existing reviews which also has a vote option.

This front-end project connects to a back-end api which I worked on previously, the link to that repo is here:
